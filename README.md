## Description
For this Week 11 Challenge we were tasked with creating a Note Taker App that can be used to write and save notes. Those saved notes will be stored in our database within the db folder, and can be deleted when you click on the red trash can button!

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/note-taker-app to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
In order to use this app you will first need to navigate to the `server.js` file and open up a terminal. When the terminal is open, run the command `npm i` to install your dependencies. When those are finished installing, type `node server.js` into your GitBash terminal. That will open up our localhost on port 3001 which will be running our live note taker application. Click on that link `http://localhost:3001` to view it within the browser. Once you are there, you can add a new note by typing the `Note Title` & `Note Text` and clicking on the save icon in the upper right hand corner. After your note is saved, you will then see it generated on the left side of the screen along with a red trash icon. The trash icon represents a delete button, and when pressed will delete the note from our database and remove it from the screen!
